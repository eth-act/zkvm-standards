# zkVM Standards for Ethereum

This repository contains tentative standards for zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs) used in the Ethereum ecosystem. They can be used outside of the Ethereum ecosystem, however we note this as the main rationale for some of the design decisions.

## Motivation

As zkVMs become increasingly important for Ethereum's scaling roadmap, there's a need for standardization to ensure that guest programs can run on different zkVM implementations with minor changes.

## Status

**These standards are tentative and under active development.**

Feedback and contributions are welcome! Please open issues or PRs to discuss changes.
